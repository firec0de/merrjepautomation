<h1>An automated bot for Merrjep.al.</h1>

<p>The software was developed using Java and Selenium. I replicated the steps he needed to make in order to refresh his product on top of the page and created multiple loops and cases to execute the refresh procedure for each of the added cars on the GUI.

The Software offered a lot of features such as to see the bot running, to add cars remove cars, save the car list, modify it and load different lists, to set a timer between the refreshes and how many times you wanted to refresh.

The software was developed with a user-friendly design it offers the possibility to add a name to the car for easier recognition and the link of the car.

The software implements a license number to prevent unwanted redistribution of software each client has its license and account.
So it's not possible to transfer the software on different computers</p>
